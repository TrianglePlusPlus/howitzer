    <h1>Django</h1>
    <p class="lead">I my self am learning Python and at a pretty advanced stage.  I have to learn how to work with variables and how to use them to my advantage, and many many other stuff.  Just remember you can do what ever you want in life if you really want it and it is your passion,  you need to try for the things you want in life,  if you really want to learn it then you can learn it. And remember to never give up,  and never call your self a bad programmer,  a bad programmer would be someone who doesn't no what print( "Test")  does, if you know the code and what you are writing then you no what you are doing.</p>
