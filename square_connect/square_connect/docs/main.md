## Services
These are the docs for the Square Connect Project, written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [Django](http://djangoproject.com/), by Students of Georgetown, Inc.

The Django project is divided into apps:
- __app__: houses project-wide views and templates, authentication logic, and the Service model.
- __data__: houses transaction.py, the main interface with the Square Connect API.
- __mailer__: houses models, views, and templates for the mailer that sends out scheduled reports.
- __report__: houses models, views, and templates involved with report requests and the report viewer, including generating graphs and CSV files.
